#💡 IoT Smart Lighting Control Application

This project outlines an Internet of Things (IoT)-based mobile application designed to provide seamless control and real-time monitoring of a smart lighting system. Leveraging cloud synchronization, this application enhances user comfort, improves energy efficiency, and provides centralized management for multiple lighting devices.

✨ Key Features

1. Light Level Control

Users can precisely define the desired illumination level (brightness) via a slider or input within the mobile application. The connected smart lighting system dynamically adjusts the room's output in real-time to match the user's specified settings.

2. Light Level Monitoring

The application measures the current ambient illumination level (in lux) of the user's immediate environment. This feature is achieved by utilizing the inbuilt ambient light sensor present in the user's mobile device, providing immediate environmental feedback and allowing for smart, context-aware adjustments.

3. Multi-Device Management

The system is architected to handle multiple smart lighting devices simultaneously. Users can effortlessly add, monitor, and control various devices (e.g., "Living Room Lamp," "Office Overhead Light") across different locations or rooms from a single, unified mobile interface.

4. Real-time Synchronization

Utilizing Firebase, all control changes (from the app) and status updates (from the device) are synchronized instantly across all connected user interfaces, ensuring the application always reflects the true state of the physical hardware.
